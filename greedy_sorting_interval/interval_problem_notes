How to decide on which value the interval needs to be sorted ?
------------------------------------------
"End for Extend, Start for Merge"

✔ Sort by END when you want to EXTEND a chain
✔ Sort by START when you want to MERGE or SCAN

------------------------------------------

| Problem Goal                      | Correct Sort                      | Why                                   |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Max chain / max non-overlapping   | Sort by end                       | frees earliest time for next interval |
| Merge intervals                   | Sort by start                     | sweep intervals left → right          |
| Meeting rooms / minimum resources | Sort start[] and end[] separately | measure concurrency                   |
| Weighted scheduling               | Sort by start                     | DP transitions                        |
| Overlap detection                 | Sort by start                     | simple checks                         |
| Greedy earliest finishing         | Sort by end                       | optimal scheduling                    |



1️⃣ Sort by START time — when order of processing matters

Used when you must process intervals as they arrive on a timeline

Helps in detecting overlaps, merging, sweeping line
Examples: Merge Intervals, Insert Interval, Meeting Rooms I

2️⃣ Sort by END time — when your goal is to select maximum intervals

Always choose the interval that finishes earliest — gives more room for upcoming intervals

Used for maximum chain, activity selection, non-overlapping intervals
Examples: Maximum Length Chain, Non-overlapping Intervals, Minimum Arrows to Burst Balloons

3️⃣ Sort by START, tie-break by END — when interval boundaries matter

Use when intervals may have same start but different lengths

Ensures predictable ordering and avoids incorrect comparisons
Examples: Scheduling, Ordering tasks, Nested interval checks

4️⃣ Sort by END, tie-break by START — when comparing ranges tightly

Needed when you want shortest finishing interval first, but also need consistent ordering

Helps prevent choosing unnecessarily long intervals with same end
Examples: Greedy selection variants, Choosing minimal covering intervals

5️⃣ Special Sorting (by length, cost, custom rules) — when problem defines a metric

Used when intervals have weights, profits, or priority

Interval problems with custom decision criteria
Examples: Weighted interval scheduling, CPU scheduling (shortest job first), custom DP
